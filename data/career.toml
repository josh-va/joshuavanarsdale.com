My time as an Independent Technology Consultant was dedicated to delivering tangible results for my clients through bespoke engagements. Whether it was delivering end-to-end projects or advising on strategy and policy, I always worked closely to understand my clients' needs, and delivered results that made sense to their business. I focused on ensuring that the solutions I provided fit their needs, were designed with security in mind, and that they had clear and practical technical documentation to support their ongoing use.<br><br>
One standout project was when I helped one of my clients reduce their IT operating expenditure by over 80% through a systems review. This made a huge impact to their bottom-line and really emphasises the importance of right-sized solutions. With another client, I let the acceptance and regression testing of their web and mobile applications. I worked closely with their development teams to ensure that bugs were identified, triaged and resolved, and that all changes were compiled and documented in user-centric release note documents.<br><br>
Through this time as a self-employed sole trader, I also needed to manage the organizational and administrative side of managing my work and relationships with clients. This included drafting contracts, handling invoicing and payments, scheduling work, and ensuring clear and constant communications with clients.

I was responsible for managing internal systems and infrastructure, ensuring day-to-day operations ran smoothly so the teams could focus on delivering world-class video education without being bogged down by technical hurdles. The endpoint environment primarily consisted of Windows and macOS laptops, along with an iOS mobile fleet, while the server infrastructure was split between on-premises Hyper-V clusters and AWS resources. One of my key focuses was ensuring site-to-site and client-to-site VPNs remained secure and stable as business needs evolved.<br><br>
I managed and supported a wide array of platforms that empowered the enterprise, including Office365, Exchange Online, Entra ID SSO, Dialpad, Slack, and Zoom, as well as team-specific tools like Jira, Monday.com, and Adobe Suite. I also managed security applications including CrowdStrike, 1Password, and OpenVPN, ensuring a cybersecurity stance that was strong yet low-impact to users.<br><br>
In addition to administration, I played a key role in risk and compliance operations, overseeing ISO/IEC 27001 and Cyber Essentials Plus certifications. I conducted internal audits, developed and implemented technical and policy solutions, and worked closely with auditors and leadership to ensure a strong compliance and security posture.<br><br>
I also led Quality Assurance for ClickView's products, ensuring rigorous software testing processes were in place. By identifying and resolving bugs, standardizing QA practices, and publishing user-centric release notes, I helped ensure products met the highest standards of quality and usability.<br><br>
One of the major projects I led was the upgrade of an on-demand HD TV recording service, which provides 24/7 Free-To-Air recorded TV access to over 5,000 schools across Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. This involved the architecture and deployment of bespoke hardware stacks to multiple data centers around the world and seamlessly cutting the services over to minimize any customer interruptions.<br><br>
Finally, I helped the company adapt to evolving needs by transitioning from on-premises to cloud-hosted telephony (cutting costs by 40%), coordinating the shift to remote and hybrid work arrangements, and streamlining IT support by engaging a managed service provider. These projects helped to ensure that resources were scalable as the company continued to grow.
